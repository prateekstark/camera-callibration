Some of Sumantra's notes to get the old code to run well:
- LAPACK and BLAS may not be installed on the system
  On a Debian machine, the packages to install are libblas-dev
  and liblapack-dev. These will have support for F77, so there
  may not be any need to install f2c (though I did it, just to be sure)
- A `make all' with the updated makefile works, in spite of the
  old K&R C used in the code
- Use the non-coplanar calibration method with full optimisation
- The camera type to be selected for the given dataset (A3) is pulnix
